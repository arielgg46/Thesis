- Objects: 10 blocks, b1, b2, ..., b10.
- Initial state: the 10 blocks are stacked into 4 stacks of increasing heights, starting with a stack of height 1. Since the description does not specify the precise configuration of blocks within each stack, we can assume any valid arrangement. For example, one possible configuration is: [b1], [b2, b3], [b4, b5, b6], and [b7, b8, b9, b10]. Here, each bracketed list represents a stack, with the first element on the table, subsequent elements stacked on top of the previous one, and the last element clear (e.g., (on-table b4), (on b5 b4), (on b6 b5), (clear b6)).
- Goal state: The goal is fully specified and unambiguous. We translate each condition into its corresponding predicate (e.g., "Your arm should be empty." -> (arm-empty), "b1 should be clear." -> (clear b1), ..., "b9 should be on b10." -> (on b9 b10), "b10 should be on the table." -> (on-table b10)).
