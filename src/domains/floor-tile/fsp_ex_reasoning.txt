- Objects: 2 colors: color1 and color2; 9 tiles: tile1. tile2, ..., tile9; only mentions one robot "The first robot": robot1.
- Initial state: The description states that 9 unpainted tiles are arranged in a 3x3 grid, in 2 rings. Since the 9 tiles are unpainted, there will not be any predicate for painted tiles. Since it does not specify how the tiles are arranged, we can assume any valid configuration of a 3x3 grid. For example, one possible configuration is:
[tile1, tile2, tile3],
[tile4, tile5, tile6],
[tile7, tile8, tile9]
Here, each bracketed list represents a row of the grid, and is easy to derive the predicates that define this grid: By rows, first row gives predicates (right tile2 tile1) (right tile3 tile2), second row gives (right tile5 tile4) (right tile6 tile5), and third row gives (right tile8 tile7) (right tile9 tile8). By columns, first column gives (up tile1 tile4) (up tile4 tile7), second column gives (up tile2 tile5) (up tile5 tile8), and third column gives (up tile3 tile6) (up tile6 tile9). Furthermore, from the 2 rings mentioned, the second ring from the outside consists only of tile5, and the rest of the tiles make the first ring from the outside. "The first robot is at the the top-left corner of the first ring from the outside", this means that robot1 is at tile1, because it is at the intersection of the first row and first column, so (robot-at robot1 tile1), "and has the first color" means robot1 has the color1, so (robot-has robot1 color1). "All colors are available", so (available-color color1) and (available-color color2).
- Goal state: The goal is fully specified and unambiguous. We translate each condition into its corresponding predicate (e.g., "Tile tile1 should be painted with color color1." -> (painted tile1 color1), ..., "Tile tile4 should be painted with color color1." -> (painted tile4 color1), "Tile tile5 should be painted with color color2." -> (painted tile5 color2), ...).
