- Objects: 4 rooms: room1, room2, room3 and room4; 8 balls: ball1, ball2, ..., ball8; 5 grippers: gripper1, gripper2, ..., gripper5.
- Initial state: The description states "You have 4 rooms, 8 balls, and 5 grippers" so we must make use of the domain predicates to declare the type of each object: (room room1), ..., (room room4), (ball ball1), ..., (ball ball8), (gripper gripper1), ..., (gripper gripper5). Also "The balls are equally distributed across the rooms", this means that, because there are 4 rooms and 8 balls, there should be 8 / 4 = 2 balls in each room. Since the description does not specify the precise configuration of the balls within each room, we can assume any valid valid arrangement. For example, one possible configuration is: [ball1, ball2] at room1, [ball3, ball4] at room2, [ball5, ball6] at room3, and [ball7, ball8] at room4. This is translated to (at ball1 room1), (at ball2 room1), ..., (at ball7 room4), (at ball8 room4). "The grippers are free" and "The robby is in the first room" can be translated directly to (free gripper1), ..., (free gripper5), and (at-robby room1).
- Goal state: The goal is fully specified and unambiguous. We translate each condition into its corresponding predicate (e.g., "Gripper gripper1 should be carrying ball1." -> (carry ball1 gripper1), ..., "Gripper gripper4 should be carrying ball4." -> (carry ball4 gripper4), "gripper5 should be free." -> (free gripper5)).
